# General Installation Instructions

Follow these instructions to install a modified version of MIRTK with the SVRTK toolbox 
compiled as a package. The installation instructions assume you are using a clean Ubuntu 
installation, hence various required software are also downloaded, e.g.: Python, CMake, etc.
The software can also be installed on OSX.


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Directory Setup

cd /path/to/software/installation/directory/of/your/choice
(i.e.: /Users/user-id/Software)

mkdir reconstruction-software
cd reconstruction-software


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Install Required Software/Libraries: Ubuntu 16


# Ubuntu: 
sudo apt install git
sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-curses-gui
sudo apt-get install python

# Install libraries needed for MIRTK
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtbb-dev libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev wget zram-config


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Install Required Software/Libraries: Mac OS X

# Install 'brew' package manager from https://brew.sh/: 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# Install libraries needed for MIRTK
brew install git cmake boost tbb eigen fltk 


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Install SVRK and MIRTK 

# Download MIRTK (please use this version with additional SVRTK compilation options)
git clone https://github.com/SVRTK/MIRTK.git

# Download SVRTK into /Packages folder of MIRTK
git clone https://github.com/SVRTK/SVRTK.git MIRTK/Packages/SVRTK

# Check all software up-to-date
sudo apt-get update


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compile MIRTK with SVRTK

cd MIRTK/
mkdir build  
cd build/

cmake -D WITH_TBB="ON" -D MODULE_SVRTK="ON" ..
make -j


# If this is all installed correctly, then:
# the main 'mirtk' executable file is located in /build/bin/ folder 
# the executable files for all MIRTK and SVRTK functions are located in /build/lib/tools/ folder 


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Add Executable files to the Path

# edit path file using nano text editor:
nano ~/.bash_profile

# Enter the bottom of the text editor:
PATH=$PATH:/Users/user-id/Software/reconstruction-software/MIRTK/build/bin
PATH=$PATH:/Users/user-id/Software/reconstruction-software/MIRTK/build/lib/tools

# You may need to reboot your computer
# To test, try typing "reconstruct" in a terminal window. If it is working, the command help will show.


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Troubleshooting

# If there are issues with missing libraries when compiling, use ccmake for more details: 

cd MIRTK/build
ccmake .. 	 # make sure WITH_TBB=ON
		 # make sure MODULE_SVRTK=ON
		 
		 
# If you cannot call the binaries (i.e.: typing "reconstruct" gives nothing), try editing .profile:
nano ~/.profile instead of nano ~/.bash_profile


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Troubleshooting: out of memory errors during runtime

# In general SVR reconstruction works on machines with >= 32 RAM on Ubuntu and ~ 32G RAM on Mac OS X (due to differement memory compression)

# In case if you get "-9 error" (memory issue) - please run reconstructions with "-remote" option
# It is slower - but it amount of RAM should not exceed 20 GB (for cardiac 4D or body/placenta large ROI)

# For Linux machines with < 32G RAM - it is recommended to increase swap memory based on the following instructions:

# 1) allocate swap file with 32G (if RAM is less < 32G)
sudo fallocate -l 32G /swapfile		# or 16-64G 

# 2) update swap file permissions
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile 

# 3) set up a Linux swap area on the file 
sudo mkswap /swapfile

# 4) activate the swap file 
sudo swapon /swapfile

# 5) verify that the swap is active
sudo swapon --show


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Installation of SVRTK as a standalone package, if required

git clone https://github.com/SVRTK/MIRTK.git
cd MIRTK/
mkdir build
cd build/
ccmake .. 	# select WITH_TBB ON
make -j
pwd # copy this path for use when building SVRTK in next steps. e.g., /Users/***/software/reconstruction-software/MIRTK/build

cd ../../
git clone https://github.com/SVRTK/SVRTK.git
cd SVRTK/
mkdir build
cd build/
ccmake ..	# paste path from earlier to DEPENDS_MIRTK_DIR
make -j

# the executable files for SVRTK functions are located in /build/lib/tools/ folder
